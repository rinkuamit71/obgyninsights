            It is recommended to get your daily intake of calcium, magnesium, potassium, and vitamin D from foods. This
            is because calcium is necessary for bone health, which is a major risk factor for osteoporosis. Magnesium
            helps regulate the nervous system. It also helps regulate the hormone levels in the body.

                  It is said that estrogen is essential for the production of the male sex hormones. These hormones are
                  responsible for the development of male secondary sex characteristics such as voice, facial features,
                  body hair, etc. The female hormone estrogen is responsible for the development of female secondary
                  sexual characteristics such as breast development, menstrual cycle, etc. However, there is a
                  difference between these two hormones and they cannot be used interchangeably. If you are looking for
                  the best natural supplement to enhance your libido, the following product might be the best choice for
                  you. • Iso flavone is an estrogen that naturally occurs in soybeans and other legumes. There are many
                  types of soybeans in the market. However, there are only a few that contain isoflavones.
                  The effects of diet on the health and lifespan of women has been a subject of scientific debate for
                  decades. The current debate is about the effect of diet on the onset of natural menopause. The two
                  main theories of the effect of diet on the onset of natural menopause are; the “dietary approach” and
                  the “metabolic approach.”
                  The “dietary approach” suggests that nutrition during the reproductive years is critical for the
                  health and lifespan of women. In this theory, the effects of diet on the health of women are mediated
                  by changes in estrogen levels. A high estrogen level is associated with a longer lifespan and better
                  health in women.
                  The “metabolic approach” suggests that the effect of diet on the health of women is mediated by the
                  effect of nutrition on metabolism. A high metabolism is associated with a shorter lifespan and poor
                  health in women. In the metabolic approach, there is no direct evidence that nutrition has an effect
                  on the health of women.

                     much menopausal symptoms are reflected in voice measurements. A comprehensive review and
                     meta-analysis was carried out to identify voice-related metrics that change with menoapause.
                     Meta-analyses assessed the effects of menopause on 6 voice metrics. Voice fundamental frequency and
                     sustained vowel /a/ were found to be 0.94 and 1.18 semitones lower in post- as compared to
                     pre-menopausal women. No significant differences were found for jitter, shimmer or

                     <p>The time to benefit (TTB) of bisphosphosphosphonate therapy for the prevention of nonvertebral
                        fractures among postmenopausal women with osteoporosis was assessed. Studies were selected from
                        systematic reviews commissioned by the US Preventive Services Task Force, the Cochrane Library,
                        and the Endocrine Society. Of 67 full-text articles identified, 10 RCTs comprising 23 384
                        postmenopausal women with osteoporosis were included. Meta-analysis found that 12.4 months was
                        needed to avoid 1 nonvertebral fracture per 100 women receiving bisphosphonate therapy at an ARR
                        of 0.010.
                        Conclusion: The TTB of bisphosphosphonate therapy is 12.4 months to prevent 1 nonvertebral
                        fracture per 100 postmenopausal women with osteoporosis. These results suggest that the therapy
                        is most likely to benefit women who have a life expectancy greater than 12.3 months.
